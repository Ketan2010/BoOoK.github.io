			<h2>"BOOK" The Good Friend</h2>
			<div class="fakeimg" style="height:300; width:98%" ><img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/05/28/07/05/book-1421097_960_720.jpg" height="300" width="98%"></div>
			<p>We all need friends who would be there for us when needed and who would 
			understand us without being judgemental. And books can be our best friends for life,
			for all the right reasons. Good books enrich our mind and broaden our perspective towards life. 
			What's more, one can never feel lonely in the company of books.
			Here is list of top books, any many more in their rspective categories. search on, Read on!<br>
			Books play a significant role in our life.“When you open a book, you open a new world”.
			I believe that everyone would agree with this statement as books have become inevitable to mankind.
			For the majority of people, books are part of their everyday life. 
			A book is like a best friend who will never walk away from you
			Books are packed with knowledge, insights into a happy life, life lessons, love,
			fear, prayer and helpful advice.<br>
			On the 23rd of April the world celebrates the <strong>World Book Day</strong>.
			This day is a celebration of authors, illustrators, books and most importantly reading. 
			The main aim of the World Book Day is to encourage children to the pleasures of books and reading.
			The reason for choosing this particular date is interesting. The 23rd of April is a symbolic date
			for world literature because it is the date of death for many great authors and poets such as
			William Shakespeare, Miguel de Cervantes, William Wordsworth and many others.</p>

			<h2>Be A Good Reader</h2>
			<div class="fakeimg" style="height:300; width:98%" ><img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2018/08/14/19/47/reading-3606441_960_720.jpg" height="300" width="98%"></div>
			<h3 style="color:#003300">Start at a comfortable reading level</h3>
			<p>You can advance to more difficult reading materials from there.
			If you attempt to read material that is too challenging initially
			you are more likely to become discouraged. While challenging yourself
			to read at a more advanced level is a wonderful goal, studies have shown
			that if you allow yourself to become discouraged while reading you will
			be less likely to achieve that goal in the long run.</p>
			<h3 style="color:#003300">Expand your vocabulary</h3>
			<p>Building a greater vocabulary will make reading easier and more fun in the future.
				The more words you are exposed to, the more your vocabulary will grow.
				If you don't understand a word, first try to use context clues to figure out what it means
				. Frequently, the rest of the words in a sentence will offer hints about what a particular word means.
					Look up words in the dictionary that you do not recognize or understand.
				Write down these words to review later to solidify them in your memory and make
				them a part of your vocabulary. Keep of a collection of these words for your own reference.
				Use new words you learn in your everyday speech. Putting words into action in your everyday
				life will ensure that you remember them.</p>
				<h3 style="color:#003300">Read materials that interest you</h3>
			<p>You are much more likely to commit to reading when it is an enjoyable and engaging experience.
			If you are bored while reading, you are more likely to put the book down and engage in a different activity.
			Find books related to your hobbies, career goals, or a topic that piques your curiosity. There are books 
			that cover every topic imaginable, and the availability of local libraries, bookstores, and the Internet
			means that all of them are at your fingertips.
			Don't limit yourself to just monographs. Comic books and graphic novels are a great
			way to get children and young adults hooked on reading. Collections of short stories 
			are a good option for those who don't want to commit to reading a longer work.</p>
			<h3 style="color:#003300">Create a pleasant reading environment.</h3>
			<p>The more you associate reading with comfort and relaxation the more likely you are to
			continue developing your reading skills. Reading can become a treat, rather than a chore.
			Find a quiet place to read so that you aren’t disturbed. Avoid distractions like TV or the radio, or 
			other people prone to disturbing you. Make sure it is somewhere with good lighting where you can relax. 
			Hold the book about 15 inches away from your face (approximately the distance from your elbow to your wrist).
			Make a cozy and fun reading area. A nicely lit corner with comfortable pillows creates a great ambiance for reading.
			If you are helping someone read, stay positive! Negative feedback will only discourage a fledgling reader, so keep the environment upbeat.</p>
			<h3 style="color:#003300">Practice, practice, practice.</h3>
			<p> Studies have shown that people who spend more time reading,
			and take in a greater volume of reading material, develop a more extensive vocabulary and 
			greater reading comprehension. This improves their ability to take in knowledge more generally.
			As with anything else, developing reading skills takes work. Set aside time to read every day.
			Literacy experts disagree about exactly how much time you should devote to reading, given that 
			it varies according to age, skill level, and ability. A good rule to remember, however, is consistency.
			Try to read every day. If you need to take frequent breaks while reading, go ahead. Even while practicing, 
			reading should be an enjoyable experience.</p>
