						The book not only explores the role of love in our lives and the ways our culture has distorted its meaning,
						but guides us  with clear definitions and examples  toward a better understanding of how to cultivate it.</p>
			<p><strong>About Auther:</strong> better known by her pen name bell hooks, is an American author, professor,
						feminist, and social activist. The name "bell hooks" is

							systems of oppression and class domination.<br>
