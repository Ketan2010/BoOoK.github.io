			<h2>1.House of Leaves</h2>
			<h5 >Auther:Mark Z. Danielewski,A Horror</h5>
			<div class="fakeimg" style="height:200; width:150" ><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41jpemUkbEL._SX369_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" height="200" width="150"></div>
			<p><strong>What this book is about:</strong> Put simply, House of Leaves is one of the most
						frightening books ever written. From a fairly standard horror premise
						(a house is revealed to be slightly larger on the inside than is strictly possible)
						Danielewski spins out a dizzying tale involving multiple unreliable narrators, 
						typographic mysteries, and looping footnotes that manage to drag the reader into
						the story and then make them doubt their own perception of that story. It’s a trick
						no one else has managed to such dramatic effect, making this novel more of a participatory
						experience than any other work of literature—which, considering the dark madness at its core,
						isn’t necessarily a pleasant experience.</p>

			<h2>2.The Haunting of Hill House</h2>
			<h5 >Auther:Shirley Jackson,Horror</h5>
			<div class="fakeimg" style="height:200; width:150" ><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51gyXcg1P2L._SX322_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" height="200" width="150"></div>
			<p><strong>What this book is about:</strong> When you think about clichés in horror fiction,
			the haunted house is at the top of the list, an idea done so often it’s frequently an unintentional parody.
			Shirley Jackson, however, was no ordinary writer, and she takes the concept of the haunted house and perfects it.
			The Haunting of Hill House is simply the best haunted house story ever written. The scares come not just from 
			the malevolent actions of a house that seems sentient and angry, but from the claustrophobia we experience from 
			the novel’s unreliable narrator, Eleanor, whose descent into madness is slow and excruciating and only begins
			after we’ve been lulled into a false sense of security by the seeming relatability of her early persona.</p>
			<p><strong>About Auther:</strong> American writer, known primarily for her works of horror and mystery. 
			Over the duration of her writing career, which spanned over two decades, she composed six novels,
			two memoirs, and more than 200 short stories.
			Born in San Francisco, California, Jackson later attended Syracuse University in New York<br>

			<div class="fakeimg" style="height:200; width:150" ><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Cjdlnh9ZL._SX329_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" height="200" width="150"></div>
			<p><strong>What this book is about:</strong>In the Internet Age it is pretty easy to fall down a rabbit hole of
			pop culture obsession, and there are still dark areas of culture that have not had a wiki created around them.
			Pessl story about a mysterious underground filmmaker whose movies may or may not contain hints of dark power
			and horrific events and the journalist who becomes obsessed with him asks the reader how you can be certain
			there is a clear line between fact and fiction, then, once that wedge of doubt is established, presents a 
			terrifying fiction to fill that space.</p>
			<p><strong>About Auther:</strong>Pessl was born in Clarkston, Michigan, to Klaus, an Austrian engineer for General
			Motors, and Anne, an American homemaker. Pessl's parents divorced when she was three, and she moved to Asheville,
			North Carolina with her mother and sister.Pessl completed the novel, titled Special Topics in Calamity Physics,
			in 2004 and it was published in 2006 by Viking Penguin to "almost universally positive" reviews, translated 
			into thirty languages, and eventually becoming a New York Times Best Seller.<br>

			<h2>4.Penpal</h2>

			<p><strong>What this book is about:</strong>Pivoting on the idea that we’re often blinded by the details we can see, making 
			it impossible to see the bigger picture, Auerbach’s debut began life as a series of creepypasta
			stories on the Internet. The episodic nature of the story is ideal for the effect he achieves;
			the narrator tells of being a young boy and sending a penpal request attached to a balloon with his
			classmates, including his best friend Josh. He doesn’t receive a response until nearly a year later,
			and his life takes a turn for the bizarre shortly afterwards. A series of tragic and strange things
			happen to him and everyone around him, building a sense of dread that is only increased when the truth is revealed.</p>

			<p><strong>What this book is about:</strong>Simmons novel follows several groups of people who have The Ability,
			a psychic power that allows them to take control of others from a distance and force them to perform any action.

			<h2>6.Hell House</h2>
			<h5 >Auther:Richard Matheson,Horror</h5>
			<div class="fakeimg" style="height:200; width:150" ><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/419R8w5C3EL._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" height="200" width="150"></div>
			<p><strong>What this book is about:</strong> What Matheson taps into in this classic haunted house story is
			the universal fear that we are already lost, already broken. Hired to investigate the existence of an afterlife
			by exploring the notoriously haunted Belasco House, a team moves in and slowly succumbs to the influence of the 
			entity within an entity that only uses their own weaknesses and secret shames against them. Their descent into the 
			depths of horror is too close for comfort as a result—for everyone reading the book knows all too well that they 
			have weaknesses, and secret shames, as well.</p>
			<p><strong>About Auther:</strong> He is best known as the author of I Am Legend, a 1954 science fiction horror
			novel that has been adapted for the screen four times, the first of which, The Last Man on Earth, was co-scripted

			<h2>7.The Face That Must Die</h2>

			<p><strong>What this book is about:</strong> Campbell wrote a number of books that are absolutely terrifying, 
			but this one stands out in the way he forces the reader to completely inhabit the mind of a very sick man,
			Horridge. As he fixates on an overweight man living in his neighborhood, the reader is forced to see the 
			world consistently through his eyes. Everything is off-beat, everything drips with ominous meaning and
			horrific intent. Horridge sees the entire world as a horror that must be destroyed, and for a while the
			reader is carried along on that uncomfortable point of view, leaving them exhausted and terrified.</p>
			<p><strong>About Auther:</strong>is an English horror fiction writer, editor and critic who has been
			writing for well over fifty years. He is the author of over 30 novels and hundreds of short stories,
			many of them widely considered classics in the field and winners of multiple literary awards.
			Three of his novels have been filmed.<br>

			<p><strong>What this book is about:</strong>his is a ghost story, so we start with the storyteller. Literary critics rarely
			use this last term, preferring to talk of the "narrator". But when it comes to hauntings this traditional description 
			is fitting. Arthur Kipps is giving us a tale that he is condemned by his own memories to tell. When the novella opens,
			he is a man in late middle age, surrounded by adult stepchildren at Christmas.</p>
			<p><strong>About Auther:</strong> is an English author of fiction and non-fiction works. Her novels include The Woman
			in Black, The Mist in the Mirror and I am the King of the Castle for which she received the Somerset Maugham Award in 1971.

			<h2>9.The Terrifying Tales</h2>

			<p><strong>What this book is about:</strong> Poe had a knack for infusing everything he wrote with visceral dread.
			His characters and narrators tend towards the mentally fragile and the insane, people who are haunted by things 
			that might be literal or might be manifestations of their unsound thought processes. Either way, stories like The
			Tell-Tale Heart or The Cask of Amontillado retain their power to petrify more than a century-and-a-half after their
			publication because Poe tapped into the fundamental fear we all have that the world and people around us are not what they seem.</p>
			<p><strong>About Auther:</strong>was an American writer, editor, and literary critic. Poe is best known for
			his poetry and short stories, particularly his tales of mystery and the macabre. He is widely regarded as a
			central figure of Romanticism in the United States and of American literature as a whole, and he was one of 
			the country's earliest practitioners of the short story. He is generally considered the inventor of the detective 
			fiction genre and is further credited with contributing to the emerging genre of science fiction.<br>

			<h2>10.Haunted</h2>

			<p><strong>What this book is about:</strong> Told in alternating chapters that depict a group of aspiring writers voluntarily
			secluded in an unusual writers retreat and the stories they are writing, Haunted not only contains one of the most disturbing
			short stories ever published (“Guts,” which caused several people to faint when Palahniuk read it in public) it is also a deep 
			dive into madness as the reality TV obsessed characters start sabotaging their experiment in a quest for fame. The sense of
			suffocating dread that Palahniuk applies grows so incrementally you do not notice it until you suddenly realize you have been
			holding your breath for five pages.</p>
			<p><strong>About Auther:</strong>  is an American novelist and freelance journalist, who describes his work
			as transgressional fiction. He is the author of the award-winning novel Fight Club, which also was made into
			a popular film of the same name.<br>
