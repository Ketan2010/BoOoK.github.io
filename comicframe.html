            <p><strong>What this book is about:</strong>Akira is a Japanese manga series, written and illustrated by Katsuhiro Otomo. 
                Set in a post-apocalyptic Neo-Tokyo, the work uses conventions of the cyberpunk genre to detail a saga of turmoil.
                 Initially serialized in the pages of Young Magazine from 1982 until 1990, the work was collected into six volumes
                  by its publisher Kodansha. The work was first published in an English-language version by the Marvel Comics imprint
                   Epic Comics, one of the first manga works to be translated in its entirety. Otomo’s art on the series is considered
                    outstanding, and a breakthrough for both Otomo and the manga form. Through the breadth of the work, Otomo explicates
                     themes of social isolation, corruption and power.</p>
            <p><strong>About Auther:</strong>is a Japanese manga artist, screenwriter and film director. He is best known as the creator

            <p><strong>What this book is about:</strong>The book that gave “Batman his balls back,” as writer/artist Frank Miller so

                  ever told. Despite the fact that the comic previously returned to its darker roots in the early ‘70s, The Dark Knight 
                  Returns took it to another level.
