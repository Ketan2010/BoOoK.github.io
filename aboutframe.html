			<p>I'm <strong style="font-size:25">Ketan Patil</strong>,Engineering student,Designer and Developer of This Website. I’m a firm believer in the power of books.
			The average reading age is nine years old and I think that is appalling.
			Recent research has shown that fewer people are now reading for enjoyment. With the
			rise of television, computer games and social networking, people no longer feel 
			the need to pick up a book when they can turn on a TV set or sit in front of a
			gaming console. 
			Books have the power to transport us to different worlds, real and imagined.It is important to me to raise readers. So, I design a website "BoOok" including variety of books.
			This Work Is dedicated to all Book Lovers......
